/** POC for three-fiber and cannon (a 3d physics lib)
 *
 *  useCannon is a custom hook that lets you link a physics body to a threejs
 *  mesh with zero effort. It will automatically update the mesh with the
 *  correct positioning.
 *
 *  When components with useCannon mount they are known to cannons world, when
 *  they unmount, they'll remove themselves from physics processing.
 *
 *  Check out three-fiber here: https://github.com/drcmda/react-three-fiber
